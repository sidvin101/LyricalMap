# PLEASE READ
- While the general format of this is a Streamlit application, unfortunately the Genius API is unable to get permissions when connected to a GitHub. As a result, I am unable to get a Streamlit running on the cloud. However, the Streamlit runs perfectly locally. So, if you want to run this application, please download it and run it on your local machine. 
- Additionally, line 99 requires a GeniusAPI access token. This can be found and created here: https://genius.com/api-clients 
Please create a new api client, use http://localhost:8000 , http://localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000 as your default website, and generate the token.
- Line 219 requires an openai access key. Please provide one.
